Quantum ML Project : 

- in the Attached ".ipynb" File Ive Prepared the Data & Data Analysis & Regression Methods or Classification Methods to Analyse and Classifiy 
the \large {\textit{Entagled} States} over \large {\textit{Separable} States} .

- Over Quite Some time that I ve run some Codes 
I think the \textbf{Decision Tree Regressor} can Provide a good Classification of Entangled States over Separable ones .

-Data is  Stored in a ".npy" Format which Contains 100000 Samples 
in order to successfully run the Code you need to put all of ".npy" Files in the Same Directory as the Code
or Generate your own Data (Which Will take a Longer Time to Run) 

- there is one Issue about the Data , which is that the v of  Features in  Denstiy Matrixes (Created by qutip) 
are not Symmetrical (Distribution Function changes when you Measure in  Z axis in relate to X axis or Y axis
 )
The code is jupyter notebook using python3 kernel.

The required packages to run the code are:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

qutip

scikit-learn
