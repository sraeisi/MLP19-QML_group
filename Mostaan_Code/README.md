## Quantum ML Project : 

- in the Attached ".ipynb" File Ive **Prepared the Data** & **Data Analysis** & _Regression Methods_ or _Classification Methods_ to Analyse and Classifiy 
the **_Entagled_**  States over **_Separable_** States .

- Over Quite Some time that I ve run some Codes 
I think the **Decision Tree Regressor** can Provide a good Classification of Entangled States over Separable ones .

- Data is  Stored in a ".npy" Format which Contains 100000 Samples.
in order to successfully run the Code you need to put all of ".npy" Files in the Same Directory as the Code
or Generate your own Data (Which Will take a Longer Time to Run) 

- there is one Issue about the Data , which is that the Distribution Function of Features in  Denstiy Matrixes (Created by qutip) 
are not Symmetrical (Distribution Function changes when you Measure in  Z axis in relate to X axis or Y axis
 )

The code is jupyter notebook using python3 kernel.

The required packages to run the code are:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

qutip

scikit-learn
